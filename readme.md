The Code needs all the packages to be installed to run the properly without any errors.

Tkinter doesnt run on Kaggle or Google colab so the best way to run it is locally using pycharm or jupyter notebook.

you have to download the datasets and the ipynb file into a location and open it on pycharm, install the necessary packages and run the program.

The program takes a while to completely execute as the data is huge once the execution is completed you can see the GUI running.
